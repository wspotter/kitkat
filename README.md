## Overview

[KIT](https://KIT.dev) is a personal AI app to extend your capabilities. It smoothly scales up from an on-device personal AI to a cloud-scale enterprise AI.

- Chat with any local or online LLM (e.g llama3, qwen, gemma, mistral, gpt, claude, gemini, deepseek).
- Get answers from the internet and your docs (including image, pdf, markdown, org-mode, word, notion files).
- Access it from your Browser, Obsidian, Emacs, Desktop, Phone or Whatsapp.
- Create agents with custom knowledge, persona, chat model and tools to take on any role.
- Automate away repetitive research. Get personal newsletters and smart notifications delivered to your inbox.
- Find relevant docs quickly and easily using our advanced semantic search.
- Generate images, talk out loud, play your messages.
- KIT is open-source, self-hostable. Always.
- Run it privately on [your computer](https://docs.KIT.dev/get-started/setup) or try it on our [cloud app](https://app.KIT.dev).
