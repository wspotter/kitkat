# WhatsApp

> Query your Second Brain from WhatsApp

Text [+1 (848) 800 4242](https://wa.me/18488004242) or scan the QR code below on your phone to chat with KIT on WhatsApp.

Without any desktop clients, you can start chatting with KIT on WhatsApp. Bear in mind you do need one of the desktop clients in order to share and sync your data with KIT. The WhatsApp AI bot will work right away for answering generic queries and using KIT in default mode.

In order to use KIT on WhatsApp with your own data, you need to setup a KIT Cloud account and connect your WhatsApp account to it. This is a one time setup and you can do it from the [KIT Cloud config page](https://app.KIT.dev/settings).

If you hit usage limits for the WhatsApp bot, upgrade to [a paid plan](https://KIT.dev/#pricing) on KIT Cloud.

## Features

- **Slash Commands**: Use slash commands to quickly access KIT features
    - `/online`: Get responses from KIT powered by online search.
    - `/dream`: Generate an image in response to your prompt.

We have more commands under development, including `/share` to uploading documents directly to your KIT account from WhatsApp, and `/speak` in order to get a speech response from KIT. Feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/KIT-ai/flint/issues) if you have any suggestions for new commands.

## Source Code

You can find all of the code for the WhatsApp bot in the [flint repository](https://github.com/KIT-ai/flint). As all of our code, it is open source and you can contribute to it.
