# Automations

[Automations](https://app.KIT.dev/automations) are a powerful feature within KIT to schedule repeated jobs for KIT to do on your behalf. Automations allow you run your query automatically at a scheduled time and frequency. KIT will send its research to you as an email.
You can ask KIT to create custom newsletters, summarize news, notify you of world events etc.

KIT uses your local time zone for scheduling. You can configure, share and delete your automations from the [automations page](https://app.KIT.dev/automations).

:::info[Self Hosting]
Self hosting users need to setup Resend and [Authentication](/advanced/authentication) setup to have KIT send automation emails.
